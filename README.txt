This is an Arduino project file used by the arduino IDE. It is a text file, so it can also be opened in Notepad/Notepad++. It contains example code to implement your own RC Car project onto the arduinos on board our cars.

If you need to find documentation for hardware, here are the components which were used:

Truck: Traxxas Slash
Arduino: Arduino Uno Rev 3
Bluetooth Module: HC-04
Ultrasonic Sensors: HC-SR04
Gesture/Light/Color/Prox sensor: APDS9960

Arduino Pin Assignment:

Digital pin 0: Bluetooth Tx
Digital pin 1: Bluetooth Rx
Digital pin 2: Left Sonar Echo
Digital pin 3: Left Sonar Trig
Digital pin 4: Right Sonar Echo
Digital pin 5: Right Sonar Trig
Digital pin 6: Rear Sonar Echo
Digital pin 7: Rear Sonar Trig
Digital pin 8: Front Right Sonar Echo
Digital pin 9: Esc Servo Control
Digital pin 10: Steering servo Control
Digital pin 11: Front Left Sonar Echo
Digital pin 12: Front Left Sonar Trig
Digital pin 13: Front Right Sonar Trig

Analog pin 4: Front Center Sonar Echo
Analog pin 5: Front Center Sonar Trig

The Gesture control is wired to the SCL, SDA and CLK pins, you can daisy chain them as necessary.
